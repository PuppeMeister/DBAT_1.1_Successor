# DBAT_1.1_Successor
I'm quite disorganized in saving project progresses. Somehow it is so easy for me to forget what I've found and solved a couple weeks ago. So for this small apps, I decide to use GitHub to record every milestone. 

#About this app

This simple and small app is an utility tool which is aimed to make the DBA jobs easier. *Eventhough the development process isn't simple as coding a basic looping*.

It provides UI and it will translate the input to query language. The query will be execute at the end.
